# MS
Random MS stuff

* **Cauchy.R**: re-run the command several times to show E[X] of cauchy pdf will never converge. Take notice at the bounds of the histogram.

* **HW2.R**: loop to generate scalar with mean of randomly generated chi-sq distribution. Also, code for cute ggplot.

* **Homework 1.R**: same as HW2.R. Not sure why this file exists but I'll keep it here just in case.
